There are also less personas to fuse and collect in total.\n\nThe game also suffers a bit from having unbalanced difficulty scaling. It goes from being somewhat challenging in the beginning, to becoming quite easy in the end due to increased HP and SP resources. Merciless difficulty fixes this a bit in NG+, with the consequence of making minibosses too tanky.\n\nBut overall I would say that Koei Tecmo has done a great job implementing turn-based RPG elements into an Action RPG.

However, neither of those games are on Steam right now which is super awkward for this review. \n\nEdit: Please don't be intimidated by my playtime. This game took me around 60 hours to beat because I did all the side content, other players report that roughly 40 hours are needed to mainline the game. My playtime is even higher because I accidentally left the game running in the background a lot.\n\nEdits: grammar and spelling\n\nI put over 130 hours into Persona 5, and around 170 hours into Persona 5 Royal. I love this series. For me, this game brings me back to Tokyo and reunites me with the main cast of the two games mentioned. It was like a reunion but with only your favourite friends. However, for a newcomer, this game won't make any sense. The history Joker (the protagonist) has with each of the characters is the foundation for almost all the dialogue. The plot pulls a lot of themes and refers to a lot of characters from Persona 5. Basically what I'm saying is: this game is not a great entry point for the Persona series.\n\nDespite all that, the game is amazingly fun despite the complete departure from turn based combat. While it can often be visually overwhelming, if you're willing put up with the chaos, you can have a lot of fun. The combat is admittedly button-mashy however each playable character (8 characters) has a short list of combos and special moves which each serve to give each character a unique way to play that makes them feel different. The fusion system is back (from the previous Persona games) which allows you to execute different Personas you collect and fuse them into stronger Personas, which you use to fight. The fusion system is very stripped down in terms of complexity and depth compared to P5 and even more so compared to P5R. However, it gets the job done. \n\nThe story is always the focus with this series, and it doesn't fall short compared to the other entries. While shorter than previous entries, it still emphasizes friendship, justice, and the importance of free will. Obviously I'm not going to spoil the plot, but like I said: If you enjoyed previous stories from the Persona franchise you will most likely enjoy this one. \n\nCriticisms: the game doesn't have a daily schedule like the previous games, there aren't any confidant/social link mechanics, the voice lines are very repetitive in the menus, the game very frequently drops frames when the screen gets too busy (I'm pretty sure this is an issue with any rig, not just mine), and there aren't any options for romance whatsoever (it's not needed for the story but it allows you get attached to the characters) except for mild flirting. None of these were deal breakers for me.\n\nTLDR: Play Persona 5 (even though Persona 5 Royal is superior in every way) up until you finish the casino palace (this is a lot to ask because that's halfway through a 100+ hour game) before you play this game. I recommend P5 instead of P5R because P5 is cheaper, it's even available on PS3, and it's free with the Playstation Plus collection if you're lucky enough to get a PS5. This game is amazing, but it's better enjoyed with the context of Persona 5.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "test", "gameName": "test2"}, {"id": "90153316", "author": "072d8faa-c53b-3fe8-ae9d-dda2b6e9d879", "date": "2021-04-11", "hours": 40.96666666666667, "content": "A fantastic game, but not for the reasons I expected. Let's go over the good and the bad of this game (and it's mainly good) \n\n1) The gameplay is actually fantastic. \n\nI was worried when I heard that this was going to have Dynasty Warriors style combat. After slogging through Hyrule Warriors, I expected a lot of dull and repetitive fights, but they really did a great job of converting Persona 5's turn based combat system into real time. You swap between characters with a press of the button, throwing out their abilities and dodging enemy attacks as you keep the combos going. \n\nThe emphasis is still placed on hitting elemental weaknesses, casting buffs/debuffs and all that, but style is the name of the game when it comes to Persona 5. Just like P5, you can end a fight with an equal-level foe in 5 seconds with a nice ambush or stop a boss dead in its tracks with well selected attacks. The flow is absolutely perfect and every \"SHOW'S OVER!\" splash screen feels well earned. \n\nThere are a few flaws. There's only ONE time in the entire game when you can use all your party members at the same time and the progression of spells (Agi --> Agio --> Agidyne) is rather dull, but it's still a thrilling experience. I would not mind if every Persona game from this point forward used a combat system like this. \n\nGameplay: 9/10 \n\n2) The story is pretty cool, though nothing show-stopping. \n\nAt the end of Persona 5, everyone's character arc is pretty much resolved with a clear endpoint. Our entire cast starts the game as a group of well-rounded individuals who have for the most dealt with their inner demons. This means that we're in a situation where a lot of the game is about a group of good friends who are entirely chill with one another going around kicking ass and solving problems. \n\nNow, this isn't necessarily a bad thing. Essentially, the story is a chance to hang out with eight characters who you already like from the first game for a while. And you know what? That was actually a good feeling. Even during the moments of high drama in the plot, I found it to be a really relaxed affair. There was a certain comfort in being in such familiar surroundings. If you've played the first game, then you've already spent 100+ hours with these people and they're your friends. And being around friends is nice. \n\nI don't think anyone that hasn't played the first game would like this though. \n\nStory: 8/10\n\n3) Surprisingly, there's almost no romance stuff. \n\nThe story is a direct sequel to Persona 5, but it's apparently a version of Persona 5 where the player character chose to not date anyone. Or maybe he just chose not to date any of the Phantom Thieves girls and is actually having menage a trois with the teacher and doctor characters. Whatever. \n\nRegardless, if you were expecting to get some extra scenes with Makoto out of this game, then you'll be unpleasantly surprised to learn that there is a grand total of ONE moment in the entire game where you can ask someone to spend time with you in a romantic context, and even that is just some five minute nothing-happening scene. I was kind of shocked by this. I mean, the waifu stuff has to be about 37% of the reason people like Persona games, right? Why would they just entirely ignore that? I don't understand it.\n\nWaifus: 3/10 \n\nOverall: 8.5/10 Highly recommended, especially for anyone who's played Persona 5.

The character of Sophie and her story arc is basically a recycling of Aigis from Persona 3; Zenkichi is just Dojima from Persona 4, the reprisal of the Persona 3/4 hot springs scene (they are all the same scene) is unnecessary, unfunny, and tired. etc.\n\nI'm a pretty big Persona fan, and I've enjoyed this game. Its story is serviceable, not embarrassingly bad or even unenjoyable. But if you have played a Persona game, and especially if you have played Persona 3 and 5, you have played this game. The only difference is the gameplay, which, again, is still fun. I do appreciate them cutting the social links/calendar bullshit, because that was never really used well in past games, but there is still far too much busywork in between the dungeon crawling and combat.\n\nThe PC port is fine, at least as far as I've found.

If you haven't played persona 5/5R, most of this game won't make sense to you. The entire premise and story is built on the previous game to the extent werre you would need to look up every twist and turn in the story. This is by all accounts made for people who played the Persona 5.\n\nFor veteran players, this game is good if you want more phantom thiefs. More details below.\n\nPros\nIt's a solid story with no major plot holes.\n\nIt works in canon with Persona 5 without bending the worlds rules.\n\nThe new combat system is acceptable, but not all mechanics from previous Persona games make sense here but they have tried and mostley succeeded\n\nThe banther between characters are still as good as Persona 5, but this time you are not forced to think of the best answere to grow any character bonds.\n\nCons\nTime management is gone, the clock only moves once the main quest is complete.\n\nThey gutted the social stats with no replacement\n\nThey gutted the Arcana system and Social bonds and replaced it with the \"B.A.N.D\" System. \n(It's an attribute system, Increase HP by 5 points etc.)\n\nRomances are gone.\n\nVelvet room is a straight copy from Persona 5 but needs it's own list\npros\nAttribute boosts no longer needs incense\nlevel boosting is now a quick process.\ncons\nArcana boost is gone\nNetwork fusion and other special fusions are gone.\nMistakes now replaces all skills not only the inherited ones.\n\nThe bosses are lacking when you compare them to P5. This is an reacurring issue, the lack of time in this game means that there is no room for fleshing out characters. We know the Phantom Thiefs but who is the bad guy, more then: Scared boy growing up to be insecure, given massive powers and is now evil.\n\nMultiple cities look cool on paper, but in practice is a mess. The city is also a character in these games. Getting to know the locals in persona games is what makes the cities feel alive. Not being able to interact with the cities you travel to makes them feel like set pieces rather then cities.\n\nThe new members are cool on paper but lack pay off. The game focus on them a lot, but don't seem to have too much to say about them.\n\nThe palaces can now be revisited, this might sound cool. But in order to make the palaces replayable, they have insted gutted the character developement of the villain via his/her palace. The symbolism is also suffering a lot because of this and there is a prime example in the very beginning of the game. Example below contains spoilers for the first 2h:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Your first palace/Jail (it makes sense in the story)\nYou are infiltrating a jail that is owned by a pop idol. She was bullied when she was little and is now one of the most famous people in Japan. She gets the power to change people's hearts and she uses the power with no mercy because of her past.\n\nThey describes her as playing with people like toys. Therefor the entire jail is filled with toys and is a medieval castle for some reason? even though it's a shopping mall with parts of shibuya.\n\nAnyway. You get captured early on and the Idol wants you to be her toy, you refuses (duh) and she says \"Hmmm so you don't want to play with me, then you are a broken toy.... and broken toys is thrown in the trash\" Then they litterly throws you into a garbage room 2 blocks away.\n\nCompare this to the previous game where every action in the real world had a theme based counter part. I am mostly thinking of Kaneshiro's viewing people like ATMs and unuseful people are busted ATMs or Okumura's Palace where the employees are robots and and broken robots are thrown into the smelter and are concidered as fuel. When you learn that Okumura is running his company with an iron fist and by inducing fear in them to lose their job, There is clear symbolism.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "test", "gameName": "test2"}, {"id": "89729446", "author": "f7eeea47-0291-3009-9eff-c555828cf558", "date": "2021-04-04", "hours": 5.366666666666666, "content": "At first I was a bit skeptical on how this game might play especailly being a fan of the other persona games, but hearing a lot of good reviews about it, and seeing some gameplay I decided to try out myself.

I love that the characters still have that charm and humor we all know and love. The story is interesting for the most part.\nThe two things that I'm still trying to get used to it the combat. I like it but I don't at the same time, since I'm so used to the turn based combat with this series, and not the hack and slash from the Warriors Series (Even though I do enjoy that series as well.) And the other is the change in the day cycle. It feels weird being able to leave the new meta-verse freely when I get low on HP and SP, and immediatly come back to continue where I left off, on the same day multiple times. Not bad per say, just a weird feeling.\nLastly, when it comes to problems like bug, glitches, or crashes.

If you have played Persona 5 then yes, If you have played Persona 5 Royal, I don't think so, I personally think moving from Persona 5 Royal to Persona 5 Strikers is a downgrade but if you want to check out the new characters and some new generic persona 5 story, I am not stopping you. I will say that the new characters are the only ones worthwhile in this game. If you haven't played any Persona 5, then I don't recommend you buy it. The game is good enough to keep you entertain for sure but I doubt you're gonna spend a lot of time unless you're really a die-hard fan who has nothing to do. I do think it is a great game, but I do not think it is worth the price at the moment. I would say wait for the price to go down first. \n\n[h1]Good stuff[/h1]\n[u]New characters[/u]\nThe only reason you should play this game is to check out the 'new aigis' , 'new dojima and his daughter', and the new villains. My favourite villain would be Sapporo's Monarch just because it is kinda rare to see one of the main groups to have a good parent figure for once. The story on the other hand, it is fine but I really don't like they have a plenty of similarities with Persona 5, should've done more like Persona 5 Royal final boss did.\n[u]Music[/u]\nYea, I like Rock music.\n\n[h1]Mixed bag[/h1]\n[u]New combat[/u]\nThis is pretty much the selling point of the game, changing it from turn-based combat to action rpg. I really enjoy in about 28 hours, then I got bored. The combos are repetitive, some enemies just takes too many hits to kill ( esspecially the ones with no weaknesses ) and damn I hate grinding. They do give Arsene have skills up to like level 95, but he doesn't really have any special skills and leveling him up is such a hassle considering leveling up a lvl 40 arsene takes more experience than a regular demon that have base level around 38-42. And in order to gain access to demons with level 67 and above, you need to beat them, and they take too much hits unless you keep grinding. However, I appreciate that they took the time to make this new combat systems. Really hope they bring the system back to make a new Raidou Kuzunoha game or something else because I think Persona should stick to the turn-based combat.\n\n[h1]Bad stuff[/h1]\n[u]Phantom Thieves[/u]\nI know this is a welcome back to Persona 5 fans, but damn the phantom thieves are kinda boring. 'New aigis' and 'new dojima' carried the phantom thieves through the whole game in terms of character development. Give me something new to learn about their characters not bring back their previous problems and relate it to the current villain. Which is one of the reasons Yusuke and Haru are the only ones I kinda liked and enjoyed because Yusuke is a goofball but we actually got to see more of him being serious instead of talking about him being poor and I learned something new about Haru which is her relationship with the villain.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "test", "gameName": "test2"}, {"id": "89360338", "author": "8b765be7-2aa8-3b1f-9e55-6a0fda4784fe", "date": "2021-03-30", "hours": 32.53333333333333, "content": "Haru.

They added new characters in the game that I truly fell in love with throughout the story. This is the game that tbh everybody has good character and I liked all them.  Indeed was a good game I thought I would hate the fact that the game is not Turn-based like the original Persona, BUT honestly I like the fighting mode better when I actually played it.

I can't say I have anything substantial to say about it yet, I'm only an hour in and god knows that these games go on forever. What I can give are general impressions that might influence otherwise prying eyes:\n\n- Do I recommend this if you haven't played Persona 5 yet? So far, no. Do I think it's a requirement, though? Also no. The general impression I've gotten so far is that if you haven't had the chance to play P5 yet, it'll be weird hopping into this story with all of these characters you haven't met yet, but if you really don't have any choice, you'll make do.\n- If you HAVE played P5, you'll notice that this takes some pretty big departures from what was in that game. Most notably in the combat, which is this game's main selling point, but the area that I think will be the most contentious is that there isn't any Social Link system. P5S is a lot more linear than its predecessor. I don't think that's a bad thing, necessarily; there's so much to do in P5 that I'd happily start a new game if one hundred more hours didn't seem daunting to me. But, if that's what you really loved P5 for, it's best that you set your expectations at the gate before stepping into Strikers. This is a spin-off that acts as a semi-sequel of sorts, but no, I wouldn't call it a full-on sequel.\n- The combat is what will make or break this for you. As I said, it's the main selling point and they've stripped out all of the non-linear segments from the original game to focus on it. From what I've played so far, it's pretty typical of a Musou fighter. There's a billion enemies on screen, you have your teammates on the  side, go beat the shit out of everything that you see. They did implement some of Persona's systems, in that you do still have your gun and can cast your Persona onto enemies who might have elemental weaknesses. That's cool, but it doesn't seem very deep so far. Again, these are impressions.\n- Other than the combat and lack of the Social Link system, they've managed to maintain the Persona 5 style down to a tee. You have your animated cutscenes, fantastic score, cell-shaded art style, all the way down to the way conversations play out. Pretty impressive, seeing as I was expecting this to just be beating the shit out of everyone on screen.\n- The PC for this is... okay? It's not bad, and minus some crashing issues that have been reported, it runs well. If you're going to play this on PC, though, keep a controller on hand. You can rebind the controls, which is neat seeing as the default control scheme borders on being decent to \"who the fuck thought this layout made any sense at all?\", but it really just works better with a controller.\n\nI hope to write a fully fledged review when I'm done with this, too.\n\nAlso, Atlus: [i]bring Persona 5 to PC[/i]. If not Royal, then at least bring the original version over? Like, I get that you're still trying to test the waters and it'll take a little while to optimize your engine to run on PC, that's okay. But releasing the semi-sequel to a game that's exclusive to one platform and having it being a multi-plat title before the original game gets ported to anything else is just kind of funny to me.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "test", "gameName": "test2"}, {"id": "90616528", "author": "0c938823-7b06-3a4d-95cb-4e5d1a39b0e9", "date": "2021-04-20", "hours": 40.016666666666666, "content": "The first half of the game is the same format of, [spoiler]\"which new antagonist fits the bill with one of the protagonists?\"[/spoiler] The second half picks up a bit, but the ending falls flat due to a predictable villain with motives copied from the original Persona 5, though somehow done worse.

But also the game needs the player to know one thing and another about the phantom thieves, some other characters, persona aspects, etc. It's not 100% necessary tho but trust me you can't understand/enjoy much of the story if it is your first ever persona game! \nMany people think that Persona 5 strikers is a Dynasty Warriors game with a persona theme but nope, it's much more like a real-time action Jrpg than that.\nThe combat system is not turn-based anymore,instead it features real-time combo based combat which is a new&cool experience IMO. For me the combat was starting to get boring and smash button like in the first jail of the game but then I changed the difficulty to hard and also the game introduced more challenging enemies, so if you don't want to feel the same play on high or at least medium difficulty and also don't ignore dire shadows.\nThe combat is pretty enjoyable and a nice addition to the old turn-based combat system.\nMany main factors of P5 or persona series in general are removed or been cut down in Persona 5 strikers such as Velvet room, Social links, daily calender system, and many other stuff that are all simplified/removed. \nOverall, P5 strikers is a must play for P5 fans who couldn't wait to see phantom thieves again! but if you haven't played P5 yet or even any other persona games and also if you can't get along with the new simplified aspects of the game,then you should probably ignore the game/wait for sales.\n\nNow please keep bringing persona games to steam Atlus! \n\nP4 Spoiler P.S: [spoiler] Adachi is the best striker!

However after playing it, it does feel more like an Action-RPG than a Musou game.\n\nPersona 5 Strikers in terms of gameplay and story does feel like a true sequel to the original Persona 5. It's gameplay feels like Persona 5's but translated faithfully into an Action-RPG, whenever you encounter enemies instead of transitioning into a turn based-RPG battle, in Strikers it smoothly starts a small Action-RPG/Musou skirmish. The battle system from Persona 5 is actually still sort of present in this game as most of the Persona skills are in this game and work very similarly.\n\nThere is Persona fusion in this game, while it does feel simplified it does feel fun and useful.\n\nEvery party member in this game has a very unique playstyle and is fun to play, it is fun to try out each character and switch up your party trying to find good combinations.\n\nThe Story of Persona 5 Strikers, while i don't think its as strong as the original's story, it still does a lot that I like and has some very strong moments. Also this game feels like a real journey as you go to so many different locations. It's a real change of pace for Persona. Also the chemistry of characters in this game is quite enjoyable.\n\nAlso the new characters introduced in this game are quite likeable, perhaps some of my favourites in the series.\n\nAlso I must mention the soundtrack. It's Persona. It's a complete banger. \n \nNow to talk about performance and quality of this PC port.\nIn my experience it's been pretty good, I have had about four or five crashes, however I never lost any progress from them as I saved my progress every time I had the option. When this game crashes it is usually in a loading screen for a transition so be careful and save.\n\nAlso this game lacks 144hz support which is a shame, it also lacks options to set the level of anti-aliasing, you can only choose for it to be on or off. In 1080p the AA looks pretty bad. However if you are able to run this game with rendering scale 2.0 then do that as it will drastically help remedy the AA. \n\nI played this whole game on Mouse and Keyboard, it is actually pretty fun, moving the camera with my mouse and using m1 and m2 for my attacks. Is it better than controller? \nProbably not, but I found it fun. I did need to remap some stuff however as  some of the default keybinds aren't the greatest. Also while remapping my keybinds I discovered that some binds must always be set on keyboard, which is kinda annoying.\n\nOverall I enjoyed this game quite a bit, A great sequel to probably my favourite game of all time.\n\nHopefully we will get more Persona games on PC", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 53, "funny": 1, "recommended": true, "franchise": "test", "gameName": "test2"}, {"id": "87240126", "author": "35990dcd-ef1e-3483-921d-20c8701e44c4", "date": "2021-02-22", "hours": 20.65, "content": "You can turn into a bus mid fight\n\nps: all girls best girls (but i simp for makoto so go away)", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 684, "funny": 62, "recommended": true, "franchise": "test", "gameName": "test2"}, {"id": "87827384", "author": "bf77c2d4-ce0f-3f8c-bf26-8217990909ca", "date": "2021-03-04", "hours": 40.9, "content": "Makoto's ass do be kinda nice doe", "comments": 2, "source": "steam", "helpful": 188, "funny": 49, "recommended": true, "franchise": "test", "gameName": "test2"}, {"id": "87381023", "author": "cba33039-2f9e-3b04-9868-c672aceb9b52", "date": "2021-02-24", "hours": 4.6, "content": "this game taught me how to talk with girls", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 104, "funny": 66, "recommended": true, "franchise": "test", "gameName": "test2"}, {"id": "87625123", "author": "63807285-1dca-37c1-af9e-f6164e6c517a", "date": "2021-02-28", "hours": 51.93333333333333, "content": "So Atlus, Persona 5 Royal on PC when? :3", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 174, "funny": 5, "recommended": true, "franchise": "test", "gameName": "test2"}, {"id": "88907673", "author": "05e89d61-d723-3778-9966-8576cc96ac5f", "date": "2021-03-22", "hours": 50.56666666666667, "content": "good game, just make sure to play the original or royal first as this is a sequel (atlus please port royal to PC)", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 80, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "test", "gameName": "test2"}, {"id": "87269245", "author": "e6ffebd9-2e37-3520-bdd9-bb657c29b901", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 14.883333333333333, "content": "Now release Persona 5 Royale.\n\nPD: Makoto besto waifu", "comments": 3, "source": "steam", "helpful": 677, "funny": 23, "recommended": true, "franchise": "test", "gameName": "test2"}, {"id": "90614606", "author": "fbb59787-1205-3766-be4b-ac0a10f0aecd", "date": "2021-04-20", "hours": 52.06666666666667, "content": "Now we wait for the P5 Royal port.", "comments": 1, "source": "steam", "helpful": 44, "funny": 6, "recommended": true, "franchise": "test", "gameName": "test2"}, {"id": "87621003", "author": "bd109b02-cba6-3f4c-b874-a1647ff71841", "date": "2021-02-28", "hours": 34.016666666666666, "content": "Wait for a patch.

The only thing that's probably different in each one are the characters and stories. Persona 5 Strikers, by definition from experience, broke free from this category.\nWhat the game has retained from Omega Force's past games was the combat system, and that's about it.

The game did not captivate me as much as Persona 4 Golden or this game did. But after playing this, I wouldn't mind playing the prequel game and treat it exactly as such.

These include things ranging from plot issues (like barely acknowledging any fallout from Persona 5 original), to technical things (if you DPS bosses well enough and fast enough, it will overlap voice lines, and you often can't pay attention to them anyway because real-time boss fight).\n\nJust know these are not exhaustive, they are just the largest issues I feel I can convey well.\n\n[h2]Persona Mechanics + Combat[/h2]\n\nThis game features Warriors style combat. You know, huge crowds of enemies, relatively simple combos, flashy animations, lots of characters. All of that.\n\nHowever, it [i]also[/i] makes use of aspects from the Persona series. Such as type-affinities, 1-More, All-Out-Attacks, and more.\nThe game reflects type weaknesses in a way that makes sense for Persona, but is less-than-idea for an action game; if you are fighting an enemy with a weakness, they generally have damage resistance against anything other than that weakness.\n\nMini-boss or \"tough\" enemies have this especially bad. They may only have ~200HP, but without hitting weaknesses, you will do chip damage (maybe 2-3 each hit).\n\nThis encourages you to use any attacks with that element, and not too much else. Attacks which don't affect weakness are often more risky than helpful, as you will commit to animations, which are doing chip damage, and leave you vulnerable (yes you can often dodge/dash-cancel out of these, but not 100% of the time).\n\nThis means that will often flail wildly between trivial, and a huge pain.\nBecause enemies either flinch from any attack, and have barely 20 HP, or they have boatloads of health, and Hyper-armour most things aside from their weaknesses.\n\n[h2]High Level Structure[/h2]\n\nThe Persona series is mostly built around doing dungeon delves where you have to weight whether to keep going, and risk dying/failing, or retreat, and keep some progress, so you can get a full-heal and so some socializing to potentially get Social-Link/Confidant perks.\n\nThis game is not a normal Persona game, it's an action game. However, checkpoints are generally plentiful, you can mostly leave the dungeon/Jail whenever you want, and get a full heal + SP recovery. The only cost is loading/transition times.\n\nThis means that each miniboss or serious encounter has to be tough enough to be a threat to you from full HP & SP, or you could just get a full heal (similar to issue with Skyrim, Breath of the WIld, and similar \"you can eat your inventory\" games).\n\nIs this necessarily a problem? I... don't know?\nIt certainly feels off; if you can leave and heal pretty much for free, is there really any pressure to keep going further than a single checkpoint distance? Are there any benefits?\nBecause a player may wish to keep going, and not leave after literally every single fight, the game includes many fights which, even at-level, are an ambush + all-out-attack (essentially 2 button presses) away from clearing a fight.\n\nSo why have those? Why not just have the more significant/noteworthy fights be dangerous, and full-heal the player after winning each? After all, they can already do that, but would have to wait through loading screens.\n\nOverall, this back-and-forth makes the game pretty tedious.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\nRegardless of these thoughts, if you enjoy the game, awesome. I don't think this game is abhorrent.\n\nI just find myself wishing I'd stop and replay Persona 5 Royal again.\n\nI figured that if that was the case, \"Not Recommended\" was the closest to my feelings, and I owed it to others to leave a review.\n", "comments": 12, "source": "steam", "helpful": 71, "funny": 4, "recommended": false, "franchise": "test", "gameName": "test2"}, {"id": "88112206", "author": "02648c4e-6c56-3906-9c15-33c61a218136", "date": "2021-03-09", "hours": 45.45, "content": "How Long until P5R?

There are also less personas to fuse and collect in total.\n\nThe game also suffers a bit from having unbalanced difficulty scaling. It goes from being somewhat challenging in the beginning, to becoming quite easy in the end due to increased HP and SP resources. Merciless difficulty fixes this a bit in NG+, with the consequence of making minibosses too tanky.\n\nBut overall I would say that Koei Tecmo has done a great job implementing turn-based RPG elements into an Action RPG.

The best thing about Persona 5 was how it blended together two different genres in one - JRPG and school simulator. Here you only have one genre - hack and slash with a little bit of RPG thrown in. This means that most of the time you will be doing the same things and that is it. And if you are not into the story, you will be left burned out from the experience. \n\nOn the plus side I was pleasantly surprised that the iconic style of Persona 5 has been implemented into the new gameplay and locations. Also, the story is captivating and imaginative like in the past instalments and I do love the road-trip-in-the-summer vibe. The characters stay true to themselves and there are plenty of funny and touching moments with them. Not surprisingly the music is a blast and I do like that through DLC you may get the remastered versions of the previous games' battle music to play during the combat. Finally, the addition of cooking was a nice touch as well. Yes, there is sort of a cooking mechanic in the original P5, but here you need to first unlock the meal through a recipe, which can be collected in various ways, and then you need to gather the needed materials to prepare the meal as well.  \n\nWhere Persona 5 Strikers disappoints is in the core gameplay, environments and playability. While interesting at first, the hack-and-slash quickly becomes boring and predictable, even if it uses the weakness and Persona systems from P5. I prefer the turn-based combat as there the gameplay did not feel the same even after 100 hours in. You got the negotiations, the all-out-attacks and ambushes were more meaningful, the single vs all spells were more distinctive from one another, which Persona you had with you was more crucial. Here the gameplay practically boils down to casting spells, to which the enemies are weak, until you get to all-out-attack. Everything else has been simplified way too much. You can heal and restore SP via items at any time without any repercussions. Futaba tells you the weakness of the enemy in the beginning of the fight - bosses as well. You do not need to take down every single enemy to trigger an all-out-attack. Also, there was something terrifying and at the same special when you had to face off several enemies at once in the original P5. Here, because there are literally hordes of enemies sometimes you won't even notice some of them and they will soon all blend in together. \n\nThe jails, themselves, have kept the unique environments from Persona 5 and they are not simply hallways. However, the feeling is the same as the one in Persona 4 - you go to a jail, do the same thing and end up in the same spot over and over again. There are no intricate puzzles, no surprise roadblocks or challenges. The formula is so far the same and thus, the locations feel the same, even if they are unique in their environments. The locations are also not exempt from this - sure, you will see plenty of Japanese cities, but essentially what you are getting per city are two mini locations filled with the same convenience stores and vending machines. Also, you can not do any extra activities in the cities - it is all just roaming the same street several times, buying several items and then going back to the Jail. Sure, occasionally if you talk to a member of the Phantom Thieves they might give you a side quest, which involves more than simply going up and down the map. However, the quests, themselves, are nothing that special and the missed opportunity to have a different version of a mini-game in each city is surely missing. \n\nFinally, while I said that there are plenty of character moments you are not involved with the characters that much, apart from the main story. One of the strongest aspects of Persona 5 were the interactions you had with the Phantom Thieves and the confidants, which happened outside of the main narrative. In Persona 5 Strikers you only get some boring side quests (like I mentioned) and some lines regarding the city / the particular moment in the story. \n\nI feel like I would be in the minority of people, who expected more of the game and were left disappointed, but I had to write this review down for anybody like me, who felt in love in Persona 5 and were eagerly anticipating this game. And can you blame me - they made Persona 5 Strikers look like it is a sequel to Persona 5. Apart from the story, it is anything but a sequel. \n\n", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 13, "funny": 2, "recommended": false, "franchise": "test", "gameName": "test2"}, {"id": "87290098", "author": "441b8daf-592e-3d6a-a5ff-bbd54f391891", "date": "2021-02-23", "hours": 4.9, "content": "Persona 5 Strikers\n----------------------------------\n\"I'll reveal your true form!\" \n\nPersona 5 Strikers is a fantastic blend of musou like combat, Jrpg progression and the persona world.\nIts extremely well crafted, it doesnt even feel like a musou title at all.\nThe combat is Omega Force/Koei Tecmo staple.

PLEASE for the love of god wait for a patch. Now that I've been playing for longer the more and more issues I've been having with the pc version. It crashes often, leading me to lose progress, I've lost around 4 hours of progress in total which has been extremely infuriating. [b][EDIT: This issue has been resolved in the latest beta hotfix][/b]Performance has had dips, while not constant they're noticeable. The settings that come with the game do almost nothing, so i had to go into Nvidia control panel to make AA myself. At this point I cannot progress through one of the last jails because of a loading screen that makes my game crash each time. I do recommend the actual game but don't buy right now, will edit if there is a fix. \n\nHere's the actual review:\n\nWow ok I am pleasantly surprised by this game. At first I was worried about it being another generic warriors game but I looked into the game more and it looked more like a Persona game than warriors which is the case. So if you're worried about that, don't be. I've also been surprised of how big the jails are, you can run around them freely for the most part except from a few linear sections and minor puzzles.\n\nThe combat is so fluid. It incorporates almost all elements of Persona 5 in one way or another. You can pause time and use specials to hit an enemies weakness and then all out attack is just as satisfying as it was in Persona 5, whilst not as flashy.  Baton passes, 1 mores, buffs/debuffs, futaba support all make their way into the game as well. Fusing personas and using them in battle is still in the game, but not as expanded, which is fine and I only noticed a few times after forgetting. You can blast through the game for a lot of it but with minimal effort except the boss fights, the difficulty scaling is a little whacky. \n\nThe story is worse than Persona 5 but it does have its charm. The story feels like a copy and paste for the first 2 jails but kind of picks up around the fourth jail, which I'm glad it did. The layout of the first two jails also feel similar which i'm confused by since they are supposed to be different. For what the story is overall, it's decent enough to warrant another journey with the phantom thieves.\n\nSome misc. gripes I have with the game is that you never have enough SP so SP items are essential though they're hard to get in large quantity, but you can leave and re enter the jail with no penalty. The grinding in this game is so unnecessarily shitty for late game personas, it requires much lower level personas to reach a threshold in level before you fuse them. How do you level them up? Persona Points which are given in low quantities and increase the amount needed to level up a persona each time, this made completing the registry worse than in vanilla Persona 5 and Persona 5 Royal. Camera can also be whacky but isn't a huge deal.\n\nIf I had to rate the game I'd give it a 8/10.", "comments": 2, "source": "steam", "helpful": 6, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "test", "gameName": "test2"}, {"id": "87627166", "author": "09d6fd6f-748b-3119-87bf-8c3108112047", "date": "2021-02-28", "hours": 66.15, "content": "An amazing sequel to the original Persona 5.

However, neither of those games are on Steam right now which is super awkward for this review. \n\nEdit: Please don't be intimidated by my playtime. This game took me around 60 hours to beat because I did all the side content, other players report that roughly 40 hours are needed to mainline the game. My playtime is even higher because I accidentally left the game running in the background a lot.\n\nEdits: grammar and spelling\n\nI put over 130 hours into Persona 5, and around 170 hours into Persona 5 Royal. I love this series. For me, this game brings me back to Tokyo and reunites me with the main cast of the two games mentioned. It was like a reunion but with only your favourite friends. However, for a newcomer, this game won't make any sense. The history Joker (the protagonist) has with each of the characters is the foundation for almost all the dialogue. The plot pulls a lot of themes and refers to a lot of characters from Persona 5. Basically what I'm saying is: this game is not a great entry point for the Persona series.\n\nDespite all that, the game is amazingly fun despite the complete departure from turn based combat. While it can often be visually overwhelming, if you're willing put up with the chaos, you can have a lot of fun. The combat is admittedly button-mashy however each playable character (8 characters) has a short list of combos and special moves which each serve to give each character a unique way to play that makes them feel different. The fusion system is back (from the previous Persona games) which allows you to execute different Personas you collect and fuse them into stronger Personas, which you use to fight. The fusion system is very stripped down in terms of complexity and depth compared to P5 and even more so compared to P5R. However, it gets the job done. \n\nThe story is always the focus with this series, and it doesn't fall short compared to the other entries. While shorter than previous entries, it still emphasizes friendship, justice, and the importance of free will. Obviously I'm not going to spoil the plot, but like I said: If you enjoyed previous stories from the Persona franchise you will most likely enjoy this one. \n\nCriticisms: the game doesn't have a daily schedule like the previous games, there aren't any confidant/social link mechanics, the voice lines are very repetitive in the menus, the game very frequently drops frames when the screen gets too busy (I'm pretty sure this is an issue with any rig, not just mine), and there aren't any options for romance whatsoever (it's not needed for the story but it allows you get attached to the characters) except for mild flirting. None of these were deal breakers for me.\n\nTLDR: Play Persona 5 (even though Persona 5 Royal is superior in every way) up until you finish the casino palace (this is a lot to ask because that's halfway through a 100+ hour game) before you play this game. I recommend P5 instead of P5R because P5 is cheaper, it's even available on PS3, and it's free with the Playstation Plus collection if you're lucky enough to get a PS5. This game is amazing, but it's better enjoyed with the context of Persona 5.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "test", "gameName": "test2"}, {"id": "90153316", "author": "072d8faa-c53b-3fe8-ae9d-dda2b6e9d879", "date": "2021-04-11", "hours": 40.96666666666667, "content": "A fantastic game, but not for the reasons I expected. Let's go over the good and the bad of this game (and it's mainly good) \n\n1) The gameplay is actually fantastic. \n\nI was worried when I heard that this was going to have Dynasty Warriors style combat. After slogging through Hyrule Warriors, I expected a lot of dull and repetitive fights, but they really did a great job of converting Persona 5's turn based combat system into real time. You swap between characters with a press of the button, throwing out their abilities and dodging enemy attacks as you keep the combos going. \n\nThe emphasis is still placed on hitting elemental weaknesses, casting buffs/debuffs and all that, but style is the name of the game when it comes to Persona 5. Just like P5, you can end a fight with an equal-level foe in 5 seconds with a nice ambush or stop a boss dead in its tracks with well selected attacks. The flow is absolutely perfect and every \"SHOW'S OVER!\" splash screen feels well earned. \n\nThere are a few flaws. There's only ONE time in the entire game when you can use all your party members at the same time and the progression of spells (Agi --> Agio --> Agidyne) is rather dull, but it's still a thrilling experience. I would not mind if every Persona game from this point forward used a combat system like this. \n\nGameplay: 9/10 \n\n2) The story is pretty cool, though nothing show-stopping. \n\nAt the end of Persona 5, everyone's character arc is pretty much resolved with a clear endpoint. Our entire cast starts the game as a group of well-rounded individuals who have for the most dealt with their inner demons. This means that we're in a situation where a lot of the game is about a group of good friends who are entirely chill with one another going around kicking ass and solving problems. \n\nNow, this isn't necessarily a bad thing. Essentially, the story is a chance to hang out with eight characters who you already like from the first game for a while. And you know what? That was actually a good feeling. Even during the moments of high drama in the plot, I found it to be a really relaxed affair. There was a certain comfort in being in such familiar surroundings. If you've played the first game, then you've already spent 100+ hours with these people and they're your friends. And being around friends is nice. \n\nI don't think anyone that hasn't played the first game would like this though. \n\nStory: 8/10\n\n3) Surprisingly, there's almost no romance stuff. \n\nThe story is a direct sequel to Persona 5, but it's apparently a version of Persona 5 where the player character chose to not date anyone. Or maybe he just chose not to date any of the Phantom Thieves girls and is actually having menage a trois with the teacher and doctor characters. Whatever. \n\nRegardless, if you were expecting to get some extra scenes with Makoto out of this game, then you'll be unpleasantly surprised to learn that there is a grand total of ONE moment in the entire game where you can ask someone to spend time with you in a romantic context, and even that is just some five minute nothing-happening scene. I was kind of shocked by this. I mean, the waifu stuff has to be about 37% of the reason people like Persona games, right? Why would they just entirely ignore that? I don't understand it.\n\nWaifus: 3/10 \n\nOverall: 8.5/10 Highly recommended, especially for anyone who's played Persona 5.

The character of Sophie and her story arc is basically a recycling of Aigis from Persona 3; Zenkichi is just Dojima from Persona 4, the reprisal of the Persona 3/4 hot springs scene (they are all the same scene) is unnecessary, unfunny, and tired. etc.\n\nI'm a pretty big Persona fan, and I've enjoyed this game. Its story is serviceable, not embarrassingly bad or even unenjoyable. But if you have played a Persona game, and especially if you have played Persona 3 and 5, you have played this game.

But ymmv i guess\n\nHaru also continues to be good.\n\n[b]tldr; good combat, boring recycled story, slightly unstable port. play if you really need that much more persona in your veins, probably buy on a sale, don't expect too much. 3/5 - decent.[/b]", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "test", "gameName": "test2"}, {"id": "90841715", "author": "ada17b3e-a893-38db-a373-d47b1ab414a6", "date": "2021-04-24", "hours": 62.53333333333333, "content": "Superb sequel to Persona 5.

If you haven't played persona 5/5R, most of this game won't make sense to you. The entire premise and story is built on the previous game to the extent werre you would need to look up every twist and turn in the story. This is by all accounts made for people who played the Persona 5.\n\nFor veteran players, this game is good if you want more phantom thiefs. More details below.\n\nPros\nIt's a solid story with no major plot holes.\n\nIt works in canon with Persona 5 without bending the worlds rules.\n\nThe new combat system is acceptable, but not all mechanics from previous Persona games make sense here but they have tried and mostley succeeded\n\nThe banther between characters are still as good as Persona 5, but this time you are not forced to think of the best answere to grow any character bonds.\n\nCons\nTime management is gone, the clock only moves once the main quest is complete.\n\nThey gutted the social stats with no replacement\n\nThey gutted the Arcana system and Social bonds and replaced it with the \"B.A.N.D\" System. \n(It's an attribute system, Increase HP by 5 points etc.)\n\nRomances are gone.\n\nVelvet room is a straight copy from Persona 5 but needs it's own list\npros\nAttribute boosts no longer needs incense\nlevel boosting is now a quick process.\ncons\nArcana boost is gone\nNetwork fusion and other special fusions are gone.\nMistakes now replaces all skills not only the inherited ones.\n\nThe bosses are lacking when you compare them to P5. This is an reacurring issue, the lack of time in this game means that there is no room for fleshing out characters. We know the Phantom Thiefs but who is the bad guy, more then: Scared boy growing up to be insecure, given massive powers and is now evil.\n\nMultiple cities look cool on paper, but in practice is a mess. The city is also a character in these games. Getting to know the locals in persona games is what makes the cities feel alive. Not being able to interact with the cities you travel to makes them feel like set pieces rather then cities.\n\nThe new members are cool on paper but lack pay off. The game focus on them a lot, but don't seem to have too much to say about them.\n\nThe palaces can now be revisited, this might sound cool. But in order to make the palaces replayable, they have insted gutted the character developement of the villain via his/her palace. The symbolism is also suffering a lot because of this and there is a prime example in the very beginning of the game. Example below contains spoilers for the first 2h:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Your first palace/Jail (it makes sense in the story)\nYou are infiltrating a jail that is owned by a pop idol. She was bullied when she was little and is now one of the most famous people in Japan. She gets the power to change people's hearts and she uses the power with no mercy because of her past.\n\nThey describes her as playing with people like toys. Therefor the entire jail is filled with toys and is a medieval castle for some reason? even though it's a shopping mall with parts of shibuya.\n\nAnyway. You get captured early on and the Idol wants you to be her toy, you refuses (duh) and she says \"Hmmm so you don't want to play with me, then you are a broken toy.... and broken toys is thrown in the trash\" Then they litterly throws you into a garbage room 2 blocks away.\n\nCompare this to the previous game where every action in the real world had a theme based counter part. I am mostly thinking of Kaneshiro's viewing people like ATMs and unuseful people are busted ATMs or Okumura's Palace where the employees are robots and and broken robots are thrown into the smelter and are concidered as fuel. When you learn that Okumura is running his company with an iron fist and by inducing fear in them to lose their job, There is clear symbolism.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 2, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "test", "gameName": "test2"}, {"id": "89729446", "author": "f7eeea47-0291-3009-9eff-c555828cf558", "date": "2021-04-04", "hours": 5.366666666666666, "content": "At first I was a bit skeptical on how this game might play especailly being a fan of the other persona games, but hearing a lot of good reviews about it, and seeing some gameplay I decided to try out myself.

I love that the characters still have that charm and humor we all know and love. The story is interesting for the most part.\nThe two things that I'm still trying to get used to it the combat. I like it but I don't at the same time, since I'm so used to the turn based combat with this series, and not the hack and slash from the Warriors Series (Even though I do enjoy that series as well.) And the other is the change in the day cycle. It feels weird being able to leave the new meta-verse freely when I get low on HP and SP, and immediatly come back to continue where I left off, on the same day multiple times. Not bad per say, just a weird feeling.\nLastly, when it comes to problems like bug, glitches, or crashes.

If you have played Persona 5 then yes, If you have played Persona 5 Royal, I don't think so, I personally think moving from Persona 5 Royal to Persona 5 Strikers is a downgrade but if you want to check out the new characters and some new generic persona 5 story, I am not stopping you. I will say that the new characters are the only ones worthwhile in this game. If you haven't played any Persona 5, then I don't recommend you buy it. The game is good enough to keep you entertain for sure but I doubt you're gonna spend a lot of time unless you're really a die-hard fan who has nothing to do. I do think it is a great game, but I do not think it is worth the price at the moment. I would say wait for the price to go down first. \n\n[h1]Good stuff[/h1]\n[u]New characters[/u]\nThe only reason you should play this game is to check out the 'new aigis' , 'new dojima and his daughter', and the new villains. My favourite villain would be Sapporo's Monarch just because it is kinda rare to see one of the main groups to have a good parent figure for once. The story on the other hand, it is fine but I really don't like they have a plenty of similarities with Persona 5, should've done more like Persona 5 Royal final boss did.\n[u]Music[/u]\nYea, I like Rock music.\n\n[h1]Mixed bag[/h1]\n[u]New combat[/u]\nThis is pretty much the selling point of the game, changing it from turn-based combat to action rpg. I really enjoy in about 28 hours, then I got bored. The combos are repetitive, some enemies just takes too many hits to kill ( esspecially the ones with no weaknesses ) and damn I hate grinding. They do give Arsene have skills up to like level 95, but he doesn't really have any special skills and leveling him up is such a hassle considering leveling up a lvl 40 arsene takes more experience than a regular demon that have base level around 38-42. And in order to gain access to demons with level 67 and above, you need to beat them, and they take too much hits unless you keep grinding. However, I appreciate that they took the time to make this new combat systems. Really hope they bring the system back to make a new Raidou Kuzunoha game or something else because I think Persona should stick to the turn-based combat.\n\n[h1]Bad stuff[/h1]\n[u]Phantom Thieves[/u]\nI know this is a welcome back to Persona 5 fans, but damn the phantom thieves are kinda boring. 'New aigis' and 'new dojima' carried the phantom thieves through the whole game in terms of character development. Give me something new to learn about their characters not bring back their previous problems and relate it to the current villain. Which is one of the reasons Yusuke and Haru are the only ones I kinda liked and enjoyed because Yusuke is a goofball but we actually got to see more of him being serious instead of talking about him being poor and I learned something new about Haru which is her relationship with the villain.", "comments": 0, "source": "steam", "helpful": 1, "funny": 0, "recommended": true, "franchise": "test", "gameName": "test2"}, {"id": "89360338", "author": "8b765be7-2aa8-3b1f-9e55-6a0fda4784fe", "date": "2021-03-30", "hours": 32.53333333333333, "content": "Haru.

I can't say I have anything substantial to say about it yet, I'm only an hour in and god knows that these games go on forever. What I can give are general impressions that might influence otherwise prying eyes:\n\n- Do I recommend this if you haven't played Persona 5 yet? So far, no. Do I think it's a requirement, though? Also no. The general impression I've gotten so far is that if you haven't had the chance to play P5 yet, it'll be weird hopping into this story with all of these characters you haven't met yet, but if you really don't have any choice, you'll make do.\n- If you HAVE played P5, you'll notice that this takes some pretty big departures from what was in that game. Most notably in the combat, which is this game's main selling point, but the area that I think will be the most contentious is that there isn't any Social Link system. P5S is a lot more linear than its predecessor. I don't think that's a bad thing, necessarily; there's so much to do in P5 that I'd happily start a new game if one hundred more hours didn't seem daunting to me. But, if that's what you really loved P5 for, it's best that you set your expectations at the gate before stepping into Strikers. This is a spin-off that acts as a semi-sequel of sorts, but no, I wouldn't call it a full-on sequel.\n- The combat is what will make or break this for you. As I said, it's the main selling point and they've stripped out all of the non-linear segments from the original game to focus on it. From what I've played so far, it's pretty typical of a Musou fighter. There's a billion enemies on screen, you have your teammates on the  side, go beat the shit out of everything that you see. They did implement some of Persona's systems, in that you do still have your gun and can cast your Persona onto enemies who might have elemental weaknesses. That's cool, but it doesn't seem very deep so far. Again, these are impressions.\n- Other than the combat and lack of the Social Link system, they've managed to maintain the Persona 5 style down to a tee. You have your animated cutscenes, fantastic score, cell-shaded art style, all the way down to the way conversations play out. Pretty impressive, seeing as I was expecting this to just be beating the shit out of everyone on screen.\n- The PC for this is... okay? It's not bad, and minus some crashing issues that have been reported, it runs well. If you're going to play this on PC, though, keep a controller on hand. You can rebind the controls, which is neat seeing as the default control scheme borders on being decent to \"who the fuck thought this layout made any sense at all?\", but it really just works better with a controller.\n\nI hope to write a fully fledged review when I'm done with this, too.\n\nAlso, Atlus: [i]bring Persona 5 to PC[/i]. If not Royal, then at least bring the original version over? Like, I get that you're still trying to test the waters and it'll take a little while to optimize your engine to run on PC, that's okay.
